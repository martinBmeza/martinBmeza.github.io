<p align="justify"> I'm a Sound Engineering advanced student, currently finishing my final thesis work named "Speech Dereverberation using Deep Learning algorithms". Furthermore, I currently have a position as teaching fellow in Signal and Systems subject at Universidad Nacional Tres de Febrero, where I mainly work with audio signal processes and Python programming.
<br /><br /> I'm interested in the application of deep learning techniques to audio signal processing and analysis. More precisely, I especially like to work in applications related to speech signals.    </p>
